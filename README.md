Team 3s Version Control Deliverable

+ Description of Use Case

+ Why is it a good use of version control (Git/Github)?
The "Data Use and Reciprocal Support Agreement" (DURSA) is an ideal use for version control. It is a voluntary agreement for public and private organizations as a way to build trust for safe and secure health information exchange. The responsibilities, obligations, and expectations of the DURSA is based on previous legal precedent that each institution is held to. Every few years, the federal level DURSA changes its terms (currently undergoing Amendment Process with a current effective target date of October 1, 2018). Many organizations, including the state of North Carolina and Duke University, use the DURSA as the base model for their data sharing agreements. As the DURSA undergoes refinement, all "downstream" institutions will need to adjust their agreements accordingly.

Since the original issue in November 2009, the National Health Information Network (NHIN) has provided at least four major revisions over the last few years. As organizations adjust their terms from the national level, version control would facilitate this transition. The NHIN federal version could be created within a repository, allowing lower level institutions, like NC or Duke, to branch a version and allow for multiple members within an organization to work on updating their own DURSA. Differences between their version and the updated DURSA can be compared through their fork and thus disrecpancies can be found and adjusted. On a smaller level, each institution can create their own repository and allow individuals to work on sections/branches, make adjustments, and pull request their changes (adjustments based on the updated DURSA), to permit rapid change. Version control would allow improved tracking of changes between versions, allow stakeholders to understand how versions are different in a systematic fashion, and allow the speed with which organizations respond to changes at a federal level.
